# genealogical_analysis_R_scripts
R pipeline for analysis of SNP data (heterozygosity, PCA, IBD, clustering) based on the SNPRelate package (Zheng et al., 2012)
# 01_heterozygosity_calc 
Converts VCF data into GDS format, performs LD pruning, and calculates individual observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygosity.

02_filter_gds: Cleans the GDS dataset based on the results from 01_heterozygosity_calc (e.g., removing samples with abnormal heterozygosity or high inbreeding). If any samples are removed, it automatically performs a new LD pruning for the remaining dataset.
